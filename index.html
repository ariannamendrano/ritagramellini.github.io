The project is dedicated to exploring the rich musical heritage of Bologna and uncovering its intricate connections with the international music scene, by retrieving information from the <a href="https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/corpus/">MusicBo corpus</a>. <br>
By extracting the data available in the <a href= "https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/musicbo/sparql">Polifonia</a> knowledge graph, we explored the diverse facets of the city's music scene, including influential composers, notable musicians, and cultural organizations that have contributed to the rich musical panorama of Bologna. The retrieved information was also deepened through other endpoints, namely those of <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>, <a href="https://dbpedia.org/sparql">DBpedia</a> and <a href= "https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql"> ArCo </a>.<br> 
Our purpose is to provide a deeper understanding and appreciation of the city's remarkable cultural legacy along with its international impact.

      <!--FIRST PROJECT-->
 <p style="padding-top: 5vh; margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">
This <a href="https://melody-data.github.io/stories/published_stories/story_1686593087.71216.html">story</a> delves into the vibrant connections between individuals and cities mentioned in the MusicBo corpus, following both a quantitative and qualitative overview of the corpus' content. 
The aim was to highlight the multifaceted influences that shape the city's musical culture. The starting point for this story was the exploration of the “City” and “Person” ontologies in the Polifonia knowledge graph and, afterwards, the further research of their entities by means of the Wikidata and DBpedia endpoints. 
 <br>
 <br> 
              <b>1. Counters</b> <br>
Our initial purpose was to discover the frequency of people and cities mentioned in the MusicBo corpus. 
To construct the query, it was essential to determine the correct designation for the entity ‘person’ and ‘city’ within the Polifonia knowledge graph. 
To assist in this task, we utilized <a href="https://arco.istc.cnr.it/txt-amr-fred/">FRED</a>, a tool specifically designed to transform texts into a frame-based knowledge graph. 
The sentences inserted were: <br>
1. <i> Mozart is a person. </i> <br>
2. <i> Bologna is a city. </i> <br>
Here are the results: <br> 
              
<img src="img/fred1.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
<img src="img/fred2.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
                <br>

Then, we created the following queries, where the variables ?s stands for subject: <br>

<img src="img/queryp.png" style="width: 350px; height: auto;">
<img src="img/queryc.png" style="width: 300px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>

These queries retrieve all the people and cities cited in the corpus. The function (count(distinct ?s as ?count) provides us with the number of mentions without duplicates, as displayed in the pictures below: <br>
<img src="img/queryppl.png" alt="query people" style="width: 300px; height: auto;" >
<img src="img/querycity.png" alt="query cities"style="width: 300px; height: auto;">  
  <br>
  Once we ran the queries on Melody for the counter function, the results are displayed as follows: <br>
  <img src="img/counterpc.png" alt="Counter of the cities mentioned in MusicBo"style="width: 250px; height: auto;"> 
<br> 
<br> 
<b>1. Map </b> <br>
  To deepen our quantitative study, we decided to discover which cities were specifically mentioned. <br> After defining all map entities in the MusicBo corpus, we retrieved data about their geographical coordinates from the Wikidata knowledge graph. This was possible thanks to the SERVICE function, which allowed us to include data from the Wikidata endpoint and integrate it with MusicBo data in a single SPARQL query. This tool was particularly important in the creation of the story, as we were able to extend the capabilities of SPARQL and enrich our queries and to obtain more comprehensive results. <br> 

 <img src="img/querymap.png" alt="query map"style="width: 300px; height: auto;"> 
   <br>


  
  The map below enables us to visualize the results, which show that most cities (1042) are located in Italy. <br>
  <img src="img/map.png" alt="Map"style="width: 350px; height: auto;">  
<br> 
 <br> 
<b>3. Charts</b> <br>
To further develop our research, we created a list of the most mentioned cities and people in the corpus. 
  The results are shown in a bar chart, which ranks each city and person based on their occurrences. <br>
  <img src="img/query10c.png" alt="quey10c"style="width: 300px; height: auto;">  
<img src="img/query10p.png" alt="query1'p"style="width: 330px; height: auto;">  
   <br>
For those two queries, we used the "GROUP BY ?label ?count", which means that the query will generate groups where each group represents a unique combination of city label or person label 
   and its corresponding count, while the "ORDER BY DESC(?count)" ensures that the results are sorted from the highest count to the lowest count. Finally, the “LIMIT 10” provides only the first 10 results. <br>
   The queries’ results were the following: 

<br> 
    <img src="img/10c.png" alt="10c"style="width: 330px; height: auto;">  
    <img src="img/10p.png" alt="10p"style="width: 300px; height: auto;">  
  <br> 
   <br>
   
<b>4. Tables</b> <br>
   As in the previous function the results show Gioacchino Rossini as the most cited person, we decided to explore some aspects of his life. In order to do so, the Wikidata and Dbpedia knowledge graphs have proved to be very effective at retrieving extra information which was not available in the Polifonia knowledge graph. Once again, the SERVICE function was important for the creation of the tables’ queries, in particular to retrieve information about Rossini’s life and his notable works. 
For the first table we used the Wikidata endpoint, as shown in the following query. <br>
 <img src="img/wikirossini.png" alt="10p"style="width: 350px; height: auto;">  <br>
   To obtain the date of birth and death as years, we needed to define the date format. To achieve this, we included (year(?birthDate) as ?birthYear) and  (year(?deathDate) as ?deathYear) within the “SELECT DISTINCT” clause. These expressions extract the year component from the variable ?birthDate and ?deathDate, respectively, and assign them to new variables named ?birthYear and ?deathYear. <br>
While building the query, we added the “OPTIONAL” filter to include additional data if available, without preventing the query from generating results if the data is absent. However, our query returned all the variables that were set. <br>
An issue we encountered was that of language duplicates. This problem was solved thanks to the FILTER (lang(?label) = “en”) function, which ensured that only English labels are included in the results. This function was chosen over the other FILTER langMatches(lang(?label), “en“) as it also returned other variations of English such as “en-gb”, “en-us”, and so on. Instead, FILTER (lang(?label) = “en”) includes only those results that exactly match the set language condition. <br>
It was then necessary to include an “OFFSET” in order to refine the query. As displayed below, the initial query generated four results. By implementing this function, it was specified to skip the first three results and start from the fourth, which was the final entry. Therefore, the resulting table only displays one outcome. <br>

 <img src="img/offset.png" alt="offset"style="width: 600px; height: auto;"> 
<br>

   Here is the table as displayed on Melody: <br>
 <img src="img/rox.png" alt="offset"style="width: 450px; height: auto;">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
<br>
   <br>
For the second table the chosen endpoint was DBpedia. We followed a “Treasure hunt” approach in order to find Rossini’s URI. Here is the query used: <br>
    <img src="img/dbpedia.png" alt="offset"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  <br>
   The “FILTER regex” function allowed us to retrieve the label of all people whose name contains “Gioacchino” or “Rossini” (case-insensitive). 
   Once we found the URI, we were able to build a query that returned all of Rossini’s works, as well their premiere date. <br>
   Below you can find the query and the table. <br>
   <img src="img/querywork.png" alt="queryw"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
   <img src="img/works.png" alt="works"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
   <br>
 <br> 
   
<b>5. Chart</b> <br>  
   Our next objective was to discover the connection between Rossini and cities, which, perhaps, had been influenced by him and his melodies. Since we already had Rossini’s DBpedia URI, we decided to use it once again to explore the same knowledge graph. In the query Rossini was connected to a variable ?city, which in turn was defined in three triplets united by the UNION function. 
   This function is indeed useful whenever many resources and ontologies are found for the same concept, in this case “city”, and therefore to retrieve the most results out of the knowledge graph, as it combines all the results specified in each individual query into a single result set. 

   <br> 
   <img src="img/querymark.png" alt="querym"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
   <img src="img/mark.png" alt="mark"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  <br> <br>


   
   <b>6. MusicBo corpus</b> <br> 
   After conducting research across various datasets, we interrogated the MusicBo corpus to find out the reasons behind Rossini's popularity. By searching for the keyword “Rossini” within the corpus, we discovered sentences that are particularly representative in this regard. <br>
   
 <img src="img/poli.png" alt="poli"style="width: 600px; height: auto;"> 
      <img src="img/sentences.png" alt="sentences"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  
   <br> 
   Through the examination of these corpus sentences, we discovered that Rossini is widely acclaimed not only for the fame he achieved during his lifetime but also for the significant impact he had on subsequent musical heritage. <br>
This approach serves as a valuable method for gaining insight into the data extracted from the knowledge graphs and understanding the connections between them. <br> <br> 
      <b>7. Text search</b> <br>
  To further develop our story, we decided to add the text search feature, enabling our viewers to broaden their horizons by looking for other information concerning people within the MusicBo corpus that left a lasting mark in Bologna’s musical landscape. <br>
In this case, the query retrieves information about a person from the Wikidata endpoint based on a search term. It fetches musician’s name, and if available, also the birth and death year, along with an associated image. We employed the “SERVICE” statement to establish a connection with the Wikidata endpoint, ensuring that the extracted results exclusively feature individuals from the Polifonia knowledge graph. The variable ?musician is associated with ?wiki, indicating that the search term should be matched with the musician’s name. Additionally, to ensure the query results are in English, the SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en".}
was added. <br>

<img src="img/textsearch.png" alt="txtsrch"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  <br>
   As you can see from the results, by searching for a musician name such as Mozart, it shows the available data. <br>   
<img src="img/mozart.png" alt="mozart"style="width: 400px; height: auto;">  <br>
We could have added some other data, like the birth place or the death place, but as there were too many variables, everytime we ran the query on the Polifonia endpoint there was a “proxy error”. <br>
